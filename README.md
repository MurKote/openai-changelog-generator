## Usage

To use this GitHub Action, follow these steps:

1. Create a new workflow file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/generate_changelog.yml`).
2. Add the following content to the workflow file:

    ```yaml
    name: Generate Changelog

    on:
    push:
        branches:
        - main

    jobs:
    generate_changelog:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Generate Changelog
            id: generate_changelog
            uses: insight-llc/openai-changelog-generator@main
            with:
            openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
            changes: ${{ github.event.commits }}
        - name: Create Release
            uses: actions/create-release@v1
            env:
            GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            with:
            tag_name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
            release_name: Release ${{ github.ref_name }}
            body: ${{ steps.generate_changelog.outputs.changelog }}
    ```

3. Replace `main` with the branch you want to generate the changelog for.
4. Create a new secret in your repository named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and add your OpenAI API key as the value.
5. Commit and push the changes to your repository.

## Inputs

- `openai-api-key`: (required) Your OpenAI API key.
- `changes`: (required) The list of GitHub commits. This input should be provided as a JSON array of commit objects, where each object has the following properties:
  - `message`: The commit message.
  - `url`: The URL of the commit.

## Outputs

- `changelog`: The generated changelog in markdown format as a string.

## Example Workflow

In the example workflow provided above, the action is triggered whenever a push is made to the `main` branch. It generates a changelog using the provided commit list and creates a new release with the generated changelog as the release body.

## Example Changelog Output

Here's an example of the generated changelog output:
