Generate a changelog based on github commits using the Conventional Commit standard with gitmojis.

The changelog should:

1. have a Professional yet friendly tone: The tone should be balanced, not too corporate or too
  informal.
2. be informative: using the provided list of GitHub commits which follow the conventional commit
  standard, break them down into categories such as Features, Bug Fixes, etc. Each category should
  be a leavel 2 heading preceeded by an emoji following the gitmoji standard. Do not list categories
  that do not have any commits.
3. list each commit in the category it belongs to, based on the conventional commit standard. Commits
  that do not follow the convention commit standard should be listed at the end in an "Other" category.
  Each listing should read as a complete sentence.
4. summarize the achievements of this release in a manner that is easily understood by non-technical
  readers before listing the commits.
5. use Markdown formatting.
6. use the following syntax to create links: \`[http://www.example.com](#12345)\`. Links should
  point to GitHub pull requests and only show the pull request number prefixed with \`#\` for the github
  repository \`${repositoryOwner}/${repositoryName}\`.
7. not wrap the answer in a codeblock. Just output the text, nothing else. Here's a good
  example to follow, please try to match the formatting as closely as possible, only changing
  the content of the changelog and have some liberty with the introduction and conclusion
  paragraphs. Notice the importance of the formatting of a changelog item:
